👤 How Users Sign In as a Patient, Doctor, or Admin
Your system will have role-based authentication, meaning:

Patients, Doctors, and Admins will log in from the same login page.
The system will check their role and redirect them to the correct dashboard.
🛠 Steps for User Authentication & Role-Based Access
1️⃣ User Signs In
They enter their email & password.
The backend checks if the user exists in the database.
If correct, the backend sends back a JWT token & user role.
2️⃣ Frontend Stores User Info
The token is stored in localStorage or cookies.
The role determines which dashboard they see.
3️⃣ User Is Redirected to Their Dashboard
Patients → /patient/dashboard
Doctors → /doctor/dashboard
Admins → /admin/dashboard
