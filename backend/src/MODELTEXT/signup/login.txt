Sign Up (Registration) → When a new user creates an account.
Login (Sign In) → When an existing user accesses their account.
So, What Comes First?
If a new user (patient, doctor, or admin) doesn’t have an account yet, they should first Sign Up (Register).
After registering, they can Login (Sign In) whenever they want.

🛠️ You Need Two Pages:
1️⃣ Sign Up Page (For new users to register)
2️⃣ Login Page (For existing users to access their account)

🚀 Sign Up (Registration) Flow
The user enters name, email, password, and role (patient, doctor, or admin).
The backend saves the user in the database.
The user is redirected to the Login page to sign in.
