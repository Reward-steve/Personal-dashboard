✅ Generate reports (appointments, doctors' activities, billing).

🔹 Doctor
✅ Accept/reject appointments.
✅ View assigned patients and their medical history.
✅ Write prescriptions for patients.
✅ Update patient records with diagnoses and treatments.
✅ Chat with patients (optional).

🔹 Staff (Nurses, Lab Technicians, Receptionists)
✅ Receptionists: Register new patients, schedule appointments.
✅ Nurses: Update patient vitals and medical records.
✅ Lab Technicians: Upload and manage lab test results.

2️⃣ Database Models
A real-world hospital dashboard requires the following models:

Model_Name	            Purpose
User	                Stores user details (admin, doctor, staff, patient)
Patient	                Stores detailed patient records (medical history, vitals)
Doctor	                Stores doctor-specific data (specialization, schedule)

Notification	        Stores system notifications (appointment reminders, messages)
LabTest	                Stores lab test results and their status
Inventory	            Tracks medical supplies (medicines, equipment)


3️⃣ Controllers & Their Functions
Each controller handles requests for specific functionalities.

Controller	                Functions
AuthController	            Handles user authentication (register, login, logout)
UserController	            Handles profile updates, role management, verification
AdminController	            Handles user management, reports, hospital-wide actions
DoctorController	        Manages appointments, patient records, prescriptions
PatientController	        Handles patient-related actions (book appointment, view history)
AppointmentController	    Handles appointment scheduling, updates, and cancellations
PrescriptionController	    Manages doctor prescriptions and refills
BillingController	        Handles invoices, payments, and hospital fees
NotificationController	    Manages system notifications for users
LabController	            Manages lab test results and uploads


4️⃣ API Routes & Endpoints
A well-structured API has different endpoints for each role.

🔹 Authentication Routes
Method	Endpoint	                Description
POST	/api/auth/register	        Register a new user (patient by default)
POST	/api/auth/login	            Login and receive a token
POST	/api/auth/logout	        Logout user
POST	/api/auth/forgot-password	Send password reset link
POST	/api/auth/reset-password	Reset password with a token

GET	        /api/patient/history	        View medical history
GET	        /api/patient/prescriptions	    View prescriptions


5️⃣ Authentication & Security
🔹 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
Ensure only authorized users can access specific routes.

6️⃣ Notifications System
When a patient books an appointment, the doctor gets a notification.
When an admin approves a doctor upgrade, the user gets notified.
When a prescription is added, the patient is notified.
Example:


``const NotificationSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    user: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'User' },
    message: String,
    isRead: { type: Boolean, default: false }
});``


7️⃣ Payment & Billing System
If payments are required, implement:

Online payments (Stripe, Paystack, Flutterwave)
Automated invoice generation
Payment history for patients
Example:


``const InvoiceSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    patient: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'User' },
    amount: Number,
    status: { type: String, enum: ['paid', 'pending'], default: 'pending' },
});``


8️⃣ Folder Structure
backend/
│── models/             # Database models
│── controllers/        # Logic for handling requests
│── routes/             # API routes
│── middlewares/        # Authentication & authorization logic
│── config/             # Database & environment settings
